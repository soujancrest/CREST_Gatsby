excerpt: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) bases aquatic life criteria on how much of a chemical can be present in surface water before it is likely to harm plant and animal life. The strategy to protect both freshwater and saltwater organisms from short-term and long-term exposure is crucial to conserving aquatic ecosystems.

### United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)

United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) bases aquatic life criteria on how much of a chemical can be present in surface water before it is likely to harm plant and animal life. The strategy to protect both freshwater and saltwater organisms from short-term and long-term exposure is crucial to conserving aquatic ecosystems

### Contaminants of concern (CECs)

Contaminants of concern (CECs) such as pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) are being detected in low levels in surface water which might have an impact on aquatic life. These CECs and PPCPs act as Endocrine Disruptors that alter the normal functions of hormones resulting various health defects predominantly reproductive effects in aquatic organisms

### Use of natural materials for cleaning and housekeeping:

Replacing harmful cleaning chemicals with natural materials reduces the flow of toxic waste into wastewater. Seepage of toxic substances into water streams kills organisms which are essential for maintaining the natural ecosystem while also making it unsafe for consumption. The conventional chemical substances have a terrible impact on our waterways, air quality, soil health, and wildlife habitats

The process of planting trees and other plants to clean up contaminated soil and water. Due to recent advances in plant microbiology, phytoremediation has increasingly become more cost-effective and feasible than traditional remediation approaches for a wide range of polluted sites, while providing communities with the host of co-benefits inherently offered by trees—shade, carbon sequestration, watershed health, and habitat for wildlife”
