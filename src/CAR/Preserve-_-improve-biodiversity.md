Trees play an important role in creating safer, healthier, and more connected communities. Cleaning the air, filtering water, and protecting soil from run off while also providing shade and cooling our homes. Healthy forests are critical to conserving some of the complex ecosystems of the planet by supporting the habitats of wildlife and aquatic life and keeping the waterways healthy. 

An average homeowner can save up to 20% on energy bills but just having the right trees in the right place. Trees improve air quality, protect soil from runoff, sequester carbon and many more In one year, an acre of mature trees absorbs the amount of CO2 produced by a car driven 26,000 miles i.e., 48 pounds before releasing Oxygen in exchange.

A concerted effort to create forests through Afforestation is one of the primary goals of Climate Hub. It helps in Carbon Capture by reduction of atmospheric CO2 resulting in conducive habitats for wildlife, improving water quality, enhancing soil health, and creating natural wind breaks.

Reforestation will be done in places where the trees have been damaged or dead due to natural calamities or manmade disasters 

Plantation of native trees, medicinal herbs including hardwoods, bare-root conifers, shrubs, wildflowers, such as, White Cedar (Arborvitae), Paper Birch, American Cranberry, and Red Osier Dogwood would help reduce erosion, reduce stormwater runoff, and create habitat for pollinators.
