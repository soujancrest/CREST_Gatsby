The Back Creek Climate Hub will be a zero-wastewater discharge site. It is observed that the water in the streams of greenbrier watershed have fecal contaminants due to failure of septic systems.

The project will have an onsite wastewater treatment facility to treat the black and grey water using natural biological systems and chemical free methods. The treated wastewater will be used for farming and landscaping purposes.

There is no discharge of liquid effluent into surface waters, in effect completely eliminating the environmental pollution associated with the treatment

Effective use of wastewater treatment, recycling, and reuse contributes to water conservation through reduced intake of fresh water.

It is a wastewater management strategy that eliminates liquid waste and maximizes water usage efficiency
