Heat from the earth is trapped in the atmosphere due to high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heattrapping gases that prohibit it from releasing the heat into space. This creates a phenomenon known today as the “greenhouse effect.”

Trees help by removing (sequestering) CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis to form carbohydrates that are used in plant structure/function and return oxygen back into the atmosphere as a byproduct. Roughly half of the greenhouse effect is caused by CO2. Therefore, trees act as carbon sinks, alleviating the greenhouse effect.

On average, one acre of new forest can sequester about 2.5 tons of carbon annually. Young trees absorb CO2 at a rate of 13 pounds per tree each year. Trees reach their most productive stage of carbon storage at about 10 years at which point they are estimated to absorb 48 pounds of CO2 per year. At that rate, they release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support two human beings. Planting 100 million trees could reduce an estimated 18 million tons of carbon per year and consequently save American consumers $4 billion each year on utility bills.

There are certain methods employed to improve carbon sequestration, they are:

### Plantation of shrubs/cover crops & Improved plantations:

Shrubs are a necessary part of landscape for carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration opportunities in croplands include the use of cover crops and improved cropland nutrient management. Cover crops, grown when fields are normally bare, provide additional carbon inputs to soils. Use of cover crops such as corn, soy, wheat, rice, and cotton

### Reforestation & Urban Reforestation & Natural Forest Management: 

Additional carbon sequestration in above and below ground biomass and soils gained by converting nonforest (<25% tree cover) to forest >25% tree cover in areas where forests are the native cover type.
* Fire Management
* Avoid conversion of grasslands
* Biochar
* Alley Cropping
* Cropland nutrient management
* Improved manure management
* Windbreaks
* Grazing optimization
* Grassland restoration
* Legumes in pastures
* Improved rice management
* Tidal wetland restoration
* Peatland restoration
* Avoided seagrass loss
* Seagrass restoration
