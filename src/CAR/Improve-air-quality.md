Air Quality in Monroe County is good with negligible ground Ozone levels (O3) Smog (Smoke + Fog) is the main reason for increase in ground level ozone. It is formed when smoke from vehicles is mixed with fog. It is extremely toxic to plants and can cause breathing difficulties in humans. Vehicular pollution is reduced within the community by introducing safer means of commuting e.g., e-bikes, cycling, other sustainable commuting options etc.,

### Use of low VOC compounds:

VOCs are only one of several toxic compounds that can be found in paints. VOCs are crucial pollutants because of their contribution to the formation of ground-level ozone. When VOCs are released into the atmosphere, they react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to create ozone molecules. Ground-level ozone can have many impacts on human health and is the key pollutant that causes smog. Low VOC refers to volatile organic compounds that are not harmful to the environment and humans as they contain a lower amount of VOC content than conventional paints and create no impact on the ozone layer. All farming and afforestation activities in the property will be chemical free ensuring the end users have zero exposure to pesticides.
