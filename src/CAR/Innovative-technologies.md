excerpt: In the U.S., discarded plastic is far more likely to end up in a landfill or a facility like Covanta’s than it is to be recycled. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans recycled only 9.1% of their plastics in 2015. Waste-to-energy facilities combusted 15.5%. But the most likely destination for the plastics discarded in the U.S. is the landfill.

In the U.S., discarded plastic is far more likely to end up in a landfill or a facility like Covanta’s than it is to be recycled.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans recycled only 9.1% of their plastics in 2015. Waste-to-energy facilities combusted 15.5%. But the most likely destination for the plastics discarded in the U.S. is the landfill.

According to EPA, recycling metals, paper, and plastics recovers roughly 16 billion J of energy per metric ton of material. Burning that same ton for energy saves about 7 billion J.

Proponents of waste to energy say the technology is cleaner than other power sources. According to SWANA’s O’Brien, waste-to-energy plants emit less CO2, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides than coal-fired power plants do per unit of power.

### ENERGY POTENTIAL FROM WASTE

If all municipal solid waste headed to landfills each year could be converted to energy, we could produce enough electricity to power nearly 14 million households annually. That could be more than 12 percent of American households powered solely from garbage. In other words, we have a domestic source of energy that could power 14 million homes every year.
