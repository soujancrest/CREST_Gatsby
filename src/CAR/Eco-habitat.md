The housing units will be designed on passive architecture principles

* Highly energy efficient units with less dependency on mechanical heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting demand systems and instead use ‘natural’ sources to create comfortable conditions inside the buildings

* Passive design measures include building orientation, air sealing, continuous insulation, windows, daylighting, and ventilation to improve indoor air quality, comfort and health of the occupants by designing a building to take advantage of natural ventilation opportunities

* Priority would be given to the locally available materials to minimise the associated environmental impacts resulting from transportation.

* Design optimization to reduce the quantity of materials required for construction

* Identifying ideal land pockets while also maintaining the natural topography with minimal disturbance to the existing land conditions

* Building a cyclist and pedestrian friendly infrastructure

* Infrastructure convenient and easy to access for physically disabled.
