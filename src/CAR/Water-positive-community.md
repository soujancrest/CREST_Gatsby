The water demand for the project is primarily domestic and farming. The project intends to use rainwater for all its domestic requirements. The Annual domestic water requirement is 31,831,358 Gallons. 100% of the domestic water requirement will be met by harvested rainwater. 

The average mean precipitation of the state is 45 inches with an average of 145 days of precipitation. The site has a rainwater harvesting potential of 1,416,502,420 Gallons of water. The rainwater from rooftops and rainwater runoff from the landscape areas will be collected along the trenches and will be routed into the rainwater collection ponds. 

The collected rainwater will be filtered in the water treatment plant and distributed for domestic use.

Water consumption would be further controlled/reduced with the help of water efficient plumbing fixtures.

Elaborate and include article on effects of limestone on water.
