Zero discrimination as the motto, Climate Hub will provide equal Opportunities irrespective of Gender, Religion, Caste & Color. It is important to create a community that is fair, inclusive, and builds a workforce which reflects diversity. A diverse
community allows all contributors to contribute their knowledge, skills, and abilities to the community regardless of background, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, or any grounds for discrimination and eliminating barriers to participation.

Climate Hub follows a Diversity Policy that provides a framework for the organization to achieve the following

* Diversity in context of employment primarily refers to the equal employment opportunity provided to everyone

* Challenge unacceptable behaviors and create a climate where complaints can be raised without the fear of reprisal.

* Take firm action where unfairness or inconsistency exists

* Encourage and support diversity within the community

* Demonstrate and promote considerate and fair behavior

* Treat staff with dignity and respect and recognize and value individual skills and contributions

* Demonstrate through words and actions that diversity is an integral part of the Climate Hubâ€™s culture.

* Create an environment in which every contributor can identify and share good practice, celebrate success, and encourage positive attitudes towards diversity
