### Employment to people from surrounding rural areas thereby increasing their income levels:

A Climate Hub will need several personnel for service roles such as Construction, Administration, Security, Housekeeping, and many more. CREST would identify staff required from people in surrounding counties and provide them with skill development training to eventually hire them as part of the maintenance team for the whole property. So, the employment needs are locally fulfilled. Apart from opportunities within the community, there would be an increase in auxiliary job opportunities because of the development such as, road maintenance, kitchen support, waste management, marketplaces etc., creating a spillover effect by also improving the property prices. Climate Hub will have the capacity to provide employment to approximately 200 support staff without any discrimination based on religion, sex, race, nationality, age. This in turn positively contributes to the per capita income levels and decreases the unemployment rate of the county. Places like WV and Monroe County, have relatively less population, hence, there is potential for support to be provided at a larger scale with the help of climate Hub

### Helping people de-urbanize:

Simple living standardssuch as waste management starting at home, letting go of redundant spending habits, becoming one with nature, exploring possibilities of a minimalistic lifestyle would all become part of everyday life at Back Creek Climate Hub.
