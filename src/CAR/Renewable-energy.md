Climate Hubs are net zero-energy positive communities which produce renewable energy through solar and wind energy systems to meet 100% of the energy demand loads.

The combined annual energy consumption per household is approx. 13408kwh.

The total energy demand for the project including common areas and amenities would be approx. 4,554,147 kwh.

A solar wind hybrid energy system of 3.5MW capacity shall be installed which would produce energy of approx. 5,425,000 kwh

When solar power is not in tune with energy demand loads, the demand is met by the external electrical grid.

Net Metering is the policy that allows individuals with solar to get a credit on their electric bill for the energy they produce from their system.

Net Metering is used to compensate for energy deficiency when production is low. When energy production is greater than required, the excess energy is exported to the grid.

The West Virginia senate passed a bill that exempts solar power purchase agreements from state regulatory jurisdiction in an effort to encourage retail customer investment in solar energy.
