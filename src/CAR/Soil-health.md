Soil at Monroe County is alkaline due to the presence of limestone. Such soils are suitable for cultivation of Corn, soybeans, wheat, and truck crops such as tomatoes, lettuce, melons, beets, broccoli, celery, radishes, onions, cabbage, and strawberries. Limestone presence indicates that the soil is rich in calcium and magnesium and their cation-exchange capacity is higher than in other lowland forest soils. Other nutrients are scarce; however, soil is light and enables better water drainage due to its porous substrate

### Other benefits of lime content in soil include,

* Increase in microbial activity
* Better soil structure (air and water flow)
* Accelerates soil’s decay system
* Reduces certain acid-loving weeds such as quack grass and jimson weed
* Acts as natural irritant to insects
* Depresses acid tolerant microbial species
* Supplies Ca for “high calcium” legumes and alfalfa

Climate Hub employs soil conservation techniques involving the use to animal manure, soil from nearby creeks, and wet waste compost for soil fortification. Other techniques include

* Trenches across the slopes help in controlling water from flooding to the downstream farm areas

* Contour Bunding: Contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of ploughing and/ or planting across a slope following its contour lines. Contour bunding is a proven sustainable land management practice for marginal, sloping, and hilly land where the soil productivity is very low. It consists of narrow based trapezoidal bunds on contours to impound runoff water behind them so that it can gradually infiltrate into the soil for crop use. Spacing between two bunds is commonly expressed in terms of the V.I. (Vertical interval) which is the difference in elevation between two similar points on two consecutive blinds.

* . Cover crops: Good ground cover by canopy protects the soil like an umbrella besides conserving soil moisture and minimizing soil erosion. These crops hold those soluble nutrients, which are lost by leaching. The advantage of legumes as cover crops is the addition of organic matter.

* Mulching: Use of available plant residues as mulch reduces the soil loss considerably by protecting the soil from direct impact of rain and reducing sedimentation. A minimum plant residue cover of 30 per cent is necessarily carried with runoff. Vertical mulching to keep runoff and soil loss within the acceptable limits also reduces soil loss particularly by increasing infiltration.

* Use of FYM: Increases biomass content in the soil thereby greatly improving the soil health.
