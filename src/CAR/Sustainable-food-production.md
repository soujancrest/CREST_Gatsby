Comprehensive cropping patterns would be followed where, we cultivate all vegetables suitable for the type of soil at Back Creek, apart from fruit varieties. These will ensure, community is self-reliant on the produce from the farm as per design. However, we need to bear in mind that the farm is subject to natural disasters.

Climate Hub has a holistic farm, where Farming is practiced at various levels. This establishes the sanctity that is maintained and governed by the members themselves with expert advice. Community Farming, Personal farming, Nursery, Forest plantations, Medicinal plantations, Animal husbandry, Aqua farming, Api culture etc., are just a few components of farming at Back Creek Climate Hub. 

The community farming comprises majority of the essential farm produces based on the water availability. We need approx. 100 acres to be dedicated to fruits and vegetables with diverse cropping patterns designed to benefit the plants nutrient supply in such a way that it also promotes passive health care. The plant care and nutrient supply in the farm is done using predominantly animal manure prepared from the animal husbandry unit. 

With a potential to produce about 50 varieties of fruits and vegetables required for its 300 families throughout the year, Back Creek would quickly become a one of its kind Sustainable Farming Community Native tree/plant species which need less or no water
Improve Biodiversity

* Health benefits of taking organic food.
* Witnessed and unaltered food
* Food Miles

<quote>"Climate Hubs are food and nutrition positive communities besides being low on carbon footprint by reduction in food miles"</quote>

Moisture preservation techniques are employed to reduce water dependency of the farm by at least 50% using,

* Live mulch, garden waste and coconut waste to cover the surface.

* Soil breeding-live organic mulch as a continuous farm cover

* Active farmland manure from the animal husbandry unit

The farm is designed to be water independent; all water systems are designed based on the rainwater available in Monroe County every year. 

Irrigation techniques will be designed in consultation with experts in the field. Scientific methods would be used to calculate the sizes and placement of the storm water trenches that channelize the water falling on the site in a controlled way without any soil erosion

### Other essential Steps to improve farming at Back Creek Climate Hub include,

* Companion cropping techniques
* Natural pest control methods using locally available substances, Bio control Agents, Herbal Concoctions, trap crops etc.,

### Compost preparation:

Large quantities of waste material is available as vegetable refuse, farm litter such as weeds, Sewage sludge and animal waste from home units and common areas. Excreta can be converted into useful compost manure by conserving and subjecting it to a controlled process of anaerobic decomposition. Compost is used in the same way as Farmyard Manure and is good for application to all soils and all crops.
