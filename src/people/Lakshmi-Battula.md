<!-- ### About Lakshmi Battula -->

Following her passion and calling to give-up her well paying and respectable corporate job with ADP, Lakshmi Battula
formed Sthiranya, a non-profit organization focused on community farming endeavours. Her focus is on growing
food that is safe and leaving a planet that younger generations can thrive on. With this rate of urbanization, we are
left with fewer and fewer farmers everyday, and farming seems like a distant career option for many. ‘Make farming
important again’ is her motto and Lakshmi strives to achieve it. Laskshmi has educated over 6000 school kids and
1000 housewives, and successfully converted over 1000 acres of private farms to implement organic practices.
Sthiranya has also trained over 600 farmers and converted over 6 villages in India to organic practices. Today,
Sthiranya Farmsscape is a consulting firm dedicated to offering the highest standards of food safety (with zero
food miles) and sustainable kitchen gardens with real-time zero refrigeration and farm-to-fork experiences in urban
backyards.
