              <p>
                Constant expansion and ever growing demands of urban age have
                become major contributors for depletion of natural resources,
                Deforestation, extinction of millions of plant & animal species
                and global warming which are bringing the human race closer to
                extinction each day.<br></br>
                CREST Foundationâ€™s Climate Hubs are designed to create a
                paradigm shift in building forest ecosystems that promote
                De-urbanization by reducing urban loads, forming farm
                communities that are organic, Net-Zero & Carbon Neutral. These
                communities reduce food miles and create access to chemical
                free, unaltered, safe and healthy food. The communities also
                include herbal forests that help absorb affluents and increase
                oxygen levels in the atmosphere thereby contributing to global
                cooling. These communities adapt proven watershed techniques to
                recharge deep aquifers and increase reserves for fast depleting
                potable water besides fueling rural development & sustained
                circular economy.<br></br>
                Climate Hubs are the new age, future proof, low density
                mixed-use climate responsive habitats which include. The
                Habitats include food forests, education institutes ,
                healthcare, sports and work facilities within them providing
                free power, vegetables, fruits, milk & meat for a lifetime. The
                habitats introduce its residents to uncontaminated fresh air,
                safe water, and healthy soil while also adding wellness and
                sustainable ecosystems to their modern living standards. Climate
                Hub is designed to create an impeccable impact on biodiversity
                that helps in restoring the environmental balance & play a key
                role in safeguarding the future of the human race on planet
                earth.
