excerpt: The planet has thrived through five mass extinctions. Surely, it can handle one more. But, humans will not be able to survive even one. In fact, the next mass extinction is going to mark the end of the human race.

## Save the earth humans

Survival of the fittest is a widely accepted theory of evolution. In order to prolong our stay on earth, we must be able to survive the many changes that the planet goes through including biological, geographical, and climatic. So far, 99% of the known species since the earth formed 4.6 billion years ago have perished.

The remaining 1% adjusts to changes every single day to prolong its species. The dinosaurs did a great job of it for around 165 million years before a natural calamity led them to extinction.

Humans, being the most intelligent species on earth, have been able to accelerate growth, using technology to their benefit. However, along with that, we have also accelerated our decline.

### What have we done so far?

If we measure the entire timeline of life on earth on a human arm, humans will occupy nothing but the tip of a fingernail. We are among the newest species, surviving the ever-changing process of life on earth. To compare the gravity of this, we would like to underscore that dinosaurs occupy one block of one finger in the whole map.

If nature had its way, maybe we would have survived longer but nuclear weapons, pollution, climate change, overpopulation, and pandemics - all of which are human-made, have come in the way of natural processes, bringing us much closer than normal to extinction.

This is why, scientists say that the 6th mass extinction will be man-made.

The silver lining here is that humans are intelligent enough to find a way - we could survive for another 3-4 thousand years. But, can we do more than just ensuring survival?

### What can we do now - An insight into possible steps

Our future generations are relying on us to give them a home that’s nurturing and conducive to life. At present, we are doing exactly the opposite. We are on the verge of leaving nothing but an inhospitable environment for them, riddled with drought, hunger, and other catastrophes.

This book by (Name) tackles the problem of human survival and talks about measures that can be taken at different levels. It provides insights on the following:

- At an individual level: Changing lifestyle, thinking consciously, and optimizing consumer habits
- At an enterprise level: Changing operations and methodologies to reduce their carbon footprint
- At the government level: Building resilient infrastructure and providing sustainable frameworks for various segments such as manufacturing industries

It is time we changed our perception from trying to “save the planet” to “saving ourselves” because the planet can take care of itself. We need to protect ourselves first.
