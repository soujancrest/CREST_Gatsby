## Welcome

India is home to around 100 million farmers today. Our nation has always prided its agriculture and produce, feeding many nations across the world. Rice and wheat among other foods are the staples, grown across the country

This is possible because we are blessed with extremely fertile soil. Our grandparents and their parents earned their livelihoods through agriculture and to this day, it is considered a noble professional. Why? Because it is the source of life.

However, despite being so important, agriculture has gone through multiple struggles. The profession is still trying to recover from the abuse that “technology” and “advancements” have inflicted on it.

### The advent of Green Revolution

Mr. M.S. Swaminathan, a renowned geneticist, led one of the most crucial movements in farming – the Green Revolution – in 1965. He introduced the use of chemicals to boost the production of wheat and rice, developing high-yielding seeds, and rust-resistant strains. Furthermore, he popularized the use of modern techniques such as multiple cropping patterns to help farmers grow more varieties in a limited area of land.

Thanks to him and Norman Borlaug, who increased yield through genetically tested varieties of wheat, farmers across the world saw returns like never before. They rejoiced as the years 1950 to 1984 saw a 160% increase in whole grain production.

### Green revolution or chemical revolution?

The other side of the coin remained hidden for many years. A few scientists say that it’s too late now because the effects are obvious, and we are all paying the price.

What is the price?

The overuse of chemicals.

The intention of Green Revolution was noble. The scientists had their heart in the right place, but the ill-effects of chemicals were not given the attention they needed.

- Chemical fertilizers
- Pesticides
- Mechanization of agriculture
- Advanced irrigation practices

All these steps replaced organic manure and plant organic matter, which are the safest possible remedies to keep plants pest-free. However, procuring chemicals was extremely easy and their usage was quick as well. The results were so lucrative, that all farmers were attracted to them and happily replaced their old practices.

Who can blame them? They were finally able to enjoy high yields and good returns!

The sudden growth and results also caused farmers to ignore a key aspect of using chemicals – the dosage. Overuse, to this day, is extremely common because we all want to see quick results. Administering large quantities of pesticides and other chemicals has led to:

- Resistance in pests
- Depletion of soil health
- Loss of taste in fruits and vegetables
- Loss of nutrition in the final yield

### Planet Kriya – Rediscovering old farming techniques with a new-age push

From the struggles of the farmers before the 1950s, it is obvious that old methodologies were not lucrative, but they were safe. Green Revolution changed the direction of the tide – it was profitable, but it came with significant side-effects.

Planet Kriya, written by (name), strives to achieve a balance between the two with practices such as

- Organic farming
- Vedic farming
- Zero budget natural farming
- Permaculture

The book breaks open the current notions about farming, enabling professionals to arrive at the most ideal method for cultivation. Because, you don’t have to consume chemicals to achieve good yield!
